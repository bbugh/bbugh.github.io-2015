      <h2>20 years production programming</h2>
      <p>Overall, 23 years of programming. 15 years in web and 5 in games.</p>

      <h2>Some of the earliest e-commerce web sites ever to come online</h2>
      <p>Before there were libraries for credit card processing and Stripe and security and Heroku, there were hand-written e-commerce and custom shopping carts in PHP. One of those businesses is still actively successful today, thanks to this work.</p>

      <h2>Extensive development on 5 game engines; two mostly written by me</h2>
      <p>I have worked extensively on many AAA-level game engines. Two of them were largely written by me: a near-complete Xbox 360 rewrite of the idTech 3 engine, and an ActionScript 3 game engine built from a heavily modified IsoEngine. Unity Experience.</p>

      <p>In addition to years of experience as a corporate consultant, I have experience being one of the earliest technical members of many teams. I have been through every kind of ringer imaginable and always came out ahead.</p>

      <h2>Many exciting and challenging tech problems</h2>
